Python programming:

height = float(input("Please enter your height in m: \n"))
weight = float(input("Now enter your weight in kg: \n"))
BMI = round(weight / height ** 2)
if BMI < 18.5:
  print (f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are underweight.  :(")
elif BMI <= 25:
  print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you have a normal weight.  :)") 
elif BMI <= 28:   
  print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif BMI <= 33:
  print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are obese.   :(")
else:
  print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are clinically obese.")
